# LEMP

LEMP Install through Docker
I am setting up a LEMP install the way I would like it with L - Open Media Vault - Linux E - Nginx M - MariaDB P - PHP and MYPHPAdmin

I have followed a tutorial from Docker for local web development introduction why should you care for the LEMP setup a key note on which I did not undersatnd when I did the index.php file is to have $connection = new PDO('[DBMS]:host=[HOST];dbname=demo;charset=utf8', 'root', 'root'); - this is from great help from osteel the writer of the blog.

docker install on Debian and Install docker compose for the docker and docker compose install

Openmediavault 5 (OMV5) Complete Install and Setup including Portainer on PC - for install and setup of Open Media vault not including the OMV extras because they do not include up to date docker install the one for the docker docs dose.

I am still working through the myphpadmin setup to get it work and will update this project as I go along.
